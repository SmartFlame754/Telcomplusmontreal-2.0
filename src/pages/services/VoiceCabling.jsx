                Voice cabling, also known as telephone cabling, is the infrastructure that supports voice communication systems in businesses and residences. This system involves the physical wires and connections that enable clear and reliable voice transmission. While the rise of digital communication has transformed how we interact, voice cabling remains vital for traditional phone systems, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) setups, and other voice-related communication needs. Voice cabling can also support audio/video systems including intercoms and paging systems. A structured approach to voice cabling ensures that these systems are robust, scalable, and easy to manage.
