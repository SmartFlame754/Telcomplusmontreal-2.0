                VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) cabling is the infrastructure that supports voice communication systems using internet protocol, which allows voice data to be transmitted over a network. Unlike traditional phone systems that use dedicated phone lines, VoIP cabling utilizes Ethernet cables and network infrastructure to carry voice signals, allowing for a more flexible and integrated communication system. VoIP systems are increasingly popular due to their cost-effectiveness, scalability, and the range of features they offer, and proper cabling is essential to ensure reliable performance.
