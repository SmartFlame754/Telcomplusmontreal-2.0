                Phone cabling refers to the physical infrastructure of wires and connections that enable voice communication in residential and commercial settings. It is the backbone of traditional telephone systems, and also supports modern VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) systems, along with other communication technologies. This cabling is crucial for establishing clear, reliable voice communication, and a structured and well-maintained system ensures a dependable network. Voice cabling can also support audio/video systems including intercoms and paging systems.
