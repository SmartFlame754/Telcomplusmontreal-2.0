                Patch panel installation is the process of setting up and connecting patch panels, which are essential components of structured cabling systems. A patch panel is a hardware assembly with ports that connect incoming and outgoing network cables. It acts as a central hub, allowing for flexible and organized management of network connections. In a typical setup, horizontal cables from wall outlets or devices are terminated at the back of the patch panel, while short patch cables are used to connect the front ports to network switches, routers, and other equipment. This allows for easy rerouting or changes to the network without altering the underlying infrastructure. Patch panel installation is a critical step in creating a reliable, scalable and manageable network system.
